# Data-Dictionary-Example

We can have 3 dictionaries: 

1.) The business definition dictionary where we keep definitions like contribution and what is a submitted vs completed trade. \
2.) A general dictionary of data sources where we keep categories for qlik and google analytics so people don't have to look through each app or report. (Non-DW) \
3.) The database dictionary where we keep categories for the DW and (potentially) other databases. \
